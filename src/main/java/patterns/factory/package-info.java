/**
 * This package represents the Factory pattern of software development
 * <p>
 * Definition: The Factory Pattern defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate.
 *             Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.
 * <p>
 * Definition: The Abstract Factory Pattern provides an interface for creating families of related or
 *             dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
